Decision points
AI opponent vs two player
Statuses?
Pokemon Stadium type Sim - set levels at 100 - vs leveling - done 
Import project into pygame 
Moves with secondary effects like stat changes?
Critical hit? - Would need to be its own separate calc 
    minus the defense/attack modifiers plus a mult - 
    randint to decide 1-10 - 1 is crit?

In Scope:
Turns should be repeatable ad nasueum and be independent, 
    need a function that goes through all sub-functions for a turn
    and nothing else
STAB - Done
Traditional damage calculation - Done
Stat changing moves - growl, leer, etc
    Could store multipliers that change for each
Switching Pokemon should reset stats
What if two users have the same Pokemon? - Fixed. Used Copy module to create
    copies of Pokemon for stat changing and hp modification
Physical/Special split - Done
Potions in bag
